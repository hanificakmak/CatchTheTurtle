# CatchTheTurtle
Catch The Turtle is a fun and simple game where you try to catch a moving turtle on the screen before the time runs out. Each time you click on the turtle, your score increases by one. The turtle moves randomly every second, and a timer counts down from 10 seconds. Once the timer reaches zero, the game ends, and a "Game Over" message is displayed.
